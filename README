This is a dark scheme consisting primarily of red/orange & green/blue/purple, with support for Terminal and 7.0 users. 
Both the original dark and a light version is included, be sure to specify the version:
  :set background=dark   or   :set background=light

Colors are laid out intuitively, such that:
         action/structure syntax is tan (Control Structure: red; Commands: orange; Operators: tannish yellow)
         variables/values are blue (Identifier: greenish blue; Type: greyish blue; Constants: blue)                                   
         text/special text is white/yellow (Normal: white; Title: golden; Underline: yellow; Special: brown)
It works very well for me coding in Html, ASP, and Perl.

Screenshots (v2.1): [removed from image host, I'll need to resubmit some]

Recommended programming fonts:
  ProFont, Proggy Fonts, Dina, or Envy Code A (downloadable), as well as Lucida Console or Terminal
Set :set linespace=0  to your preferred line spread (default is 1).
